Yse library is open source library written in c++, and it supports sound cross-platform. more details, see http://www.attr-x.net/yse/.
i posted about this topic to my blog, and if you are good at Korean, see also https://minusi.tistory.com/entry/YSE-Sound-Library. i think my post will be helpful to start yse library, but it is also good to start to learn with yse demo program.
